Stacy: Oh this one is D-593, the space ruins!

Rex: OH NO I'M GONNA SUFFOCATE

Stacy: Rex

Rex: I CAN’T BREATHE 

Stacy: Rex

Rex: I’M GONNA DIE HERE

Stacy: REX

Rex: Huh?

Rex: Oh, I’m fine.

Rex: Why am I fine?

Stacy: Despite how it looks, D-593 has an expansive, encompassing atmosphere that provides breathable air throughout its entirety, so that despite its lack of gravity sound still travels and organisms can still continue to function. 

Rex: So I can breathe here?

Stacy: Yes you can breathe here.
