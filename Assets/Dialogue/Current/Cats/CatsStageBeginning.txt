Rex: THEY LOOK HORRIFYING WHY ARE THEY EVERYWHERE

Rex: THEIR BODIES ARE COVERED IN FUR AND THEY BEHAVE LIKE A LIQUID

Stacy: Ah, that must be D-:3, the feline dimension. Every part of this dimension is made up of mythical creatures called “cats”. 

Rex: IT’S GETTING CLOSER TO ME GET IT AWAY

Stacy: I wish I was there, I want to pet a cat someday. I hear they make excellent pets. 

Rex: I WANNA LEAVE

Stacy: I’ll pet a cat one day.
