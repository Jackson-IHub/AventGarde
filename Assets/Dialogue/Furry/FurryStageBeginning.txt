Rex: I think we went too far into the future, it looks like everything has evolved to be bipedal.

Stacy: Not quite, it’s just homosapiens dressed as other animals. 

Rex: Are these the pelts of animals they’ve slain?

Stacy: Quite the opposite my friend. This is D-UWU, where homosapiens create costumes of their favorite animals, usually a mammal, and congregate together to show off their costumes and engage with like minded individuals. 

Rex: What type of dino are you, a thesaurus? How do you know so much about various dimensions?

Stacy: I took an interdimensional travel course in my undergrad.
