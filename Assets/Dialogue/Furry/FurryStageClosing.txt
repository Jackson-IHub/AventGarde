Rex: How do I know you’re not a homosapien in a T-rex costume?

Stacy: I’m pretty sure there would be a zipper on my back if that were the case. 

Rex: You could’ve sewn yourself in, maybe you’re playing the long game and just pretending to be a dinosaur so you can earn my trust and ultimately betray me. 

Stacy: I can't sew, I don’t have opposable thumbs.
