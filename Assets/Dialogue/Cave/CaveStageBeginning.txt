Rex: Stacy? Hello? Stacy, where are you?

Stacy: I’m right here.

Rex: Right where?

Stacy: Beside you.

Rex: Something is next to me.

Stacy: That’s me.

Rex: When did you get there?

Stacy: I’ve been here the whole time.

Rex: Where are we?

Stacy: Given the lack of defining features besides darkness, I’d say The Cave, aka D-000. 

Rex: Ow! You stepped on my foot! Watch where you step!

Stacy: I can’t, that's the whole point.
