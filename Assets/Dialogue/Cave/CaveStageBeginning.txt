Rex: Stacy? It’s dark everywhere, did I die? Is this dino hell?

Stacy: Do you hear water dripping?

Rex: Yeah

Stacy: Then that’s D-000, the cave dimension. Almost absolute darkness filled with stone, corridors, stalactites, and salamanders. 

Rex: How do you know it’s not hell?

Stacy: There’s no water in hell. Plus you’d probably be burning alive right now. 

Rex: Good point.
