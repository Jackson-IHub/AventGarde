//66 million years ago, an asteroid was about to collide with the earth, dooming all the dinosaurs to extinction. 

//Most of the dinosaurs, that is, because two of them knew this was going to happen.

Stacy: T minus 10 minutes till impact. Do you think it will work?

Rex: Of course it will, we’re the smartest dinosaurs in existence. We managed to become scientists despite the lack of educational institutions!

Stacy: Nobel prize worthy scientists at that. One pull of this lever and we’ll have a working time dilation portal.

Rex: And we can go to the future after the asteroid collides and evade extinction.

Stacy: Would you like to do the honors?

Rex: Say less.

Sounds of a dinosaur struggling to pull a lever

Stacy: What’s the matter?

Rex: I don’t have opposable thumbs!

Stacy: How did we build a time dilation portal then?

Rex: Nevermind that, we have to activate the portal. Hit the emergency jumpstart button!

Stacy: But we haven’t tested it! It could malfunction and send us to a random dimension!

Rex: Now’s not the time to worry about that, any dimension is better than this one when that asteroid hits! 

Stacy: Here goes nothing!

//Button press sound

Stacy: It’s working, let’s get out of here!
