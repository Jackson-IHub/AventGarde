Rex: This doesn’t quite look like D-616 does it. Where did we end up?

Rex: Stacy? Hello? Where are you?

Stacy: Coming in, Rex, do you hear me?

Rex: What was that? 

Rex: Oh right, the interdimensional digital communication system.

Rex: I hear you, over. 

Stacy: I made it to D-616, where are you?

Rex: I’m in the woods somewhere, it looks like it's autumn here. 

Stacy: Ah, that sounds like D-411, the endless woods. Known for its lush forests and beautiful fall landscape. 

Rex: That’s great and all, but where am I going to buy more volumetric flasks? I don’t see a supply store anywhere around here. 

Stacy: Well you can’t go back through the portal yet, it has to recalibrate. Looks like you’re stuck there for a bit. 

Rex: How come you made it over and I didn’t?

Stacy: I don’t think the portal was able to handle two dinosaurs in quick succession. After I went through it probably got messed up a bit, so when you went after me you got thrown into a random dimension.  

Stacy: Not to worry, I’ll talk you through how to navigate it.
